00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.342
Aceasta este o subtitrare pentru o melodie

00:00:06.342 --> 00:00:08.961
insa, din fericire,

00:00:08.961 --> 00:00:13.641
melodiile lui Chopin nu au nevoie de asa ceva. :)

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:15.354
and standards are the main way we get there.

00:00:15.354 --> 00:00:17.454
As a developer, that is the dream come true

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.324
you just write your site once, and,

00:00:19.324 --> 00:00:22.530
and no matter where it's being shown, 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.318
in what browser, on what platform, it's running the same way, in the same code. 

00:00:26.318 --> 00:00:28.587
if we behave differently than other browsers, 

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:32.930
or the standards aren't written in a way that leads to interoperable implementations,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.018
then developers just end up wasting their time. 

00:00:35.018 --> 00:00:37.407
rather than building cool things. 

00:00:37.407 --> 00:00:39.097
that we'll enjoy.

00:00:39.097 --> 00:00:43.965
Platform Preview really gave us an opportunity to get

00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:47.467
early bits into developers hands.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:50.367
In previous releases we would do the best we could

00:00:50.367 --> 00:00:53.249
from an engineering standpoint, and then we would ship a beta, 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.921
and that would be the first time that really the public could

00:00:55.921 --> 00:00:57.727
get their hands on the code 

00:00:57.727 --> 00:01:00.537
and run the websites and find the problems

00:01:00.537 --> 00:01:02.737
and get feedback to us.

00:01:02.737 --> 00:01:07.072
So we realized we needed to get, we needed to get that feedback earlier, 

00:01:07.072 --> 00:01:09.282
and we really wanted to put the code into developer's hands sooner.

00:01:09.282 --> 00:01:15.178
It's difficult when all the specs are moving, including HTML5 is a moving spec right now, 

00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:16.858
CSS3 is a moving spec right now,

00:01:16.858 --> 00:01:19.923
and we are coding, and we're trying to ship a product.

00:01:19.923 --> 00:01:22.649
So, it's difficult to hit those moving targets.

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.309
We have several people who were on the working groups.

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:29.399
This means weekly conference calls,

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.995
 face to face meetings, all over the world. 

00:01:32.995 --> 00:01:35.112
The W3c does a technical plenary.

00:01:35.112 --> 00:01:37.859
in the fall that they move in different cities each year

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.219
and it's really commiting the time and resources 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.703
and engaging the working groups and putting in the effort

00:01:44.703 --> 00:01:50.526
to make sure the standards evolve at a good pace, and with good quality

00:01:50.526 --> 00:01:52.942
It's a meeting of incredibly smart people who have 

00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:56.852
very strong ideas about the web and are very passionate about those ideas

00:01:56.852 --> 00:01:58.852
and, and it can get heated!

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:02.754
but ultimately we recognize that we're part of a standards body and

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:04.752
we're trying to make the Internet better for everyone.

00:02:04.752 --> 00:02:08.837
 So we usually can come to some kind of a rational decision. 

00:02:08.837 --> 00:02:13.387
Typically what we do at Microsoft, to get feedback to the W3c is

00:02:13.387 --> 00:02:14.885
is submit test cases.

00:02:14.885 --> 00:02:19.315
 So we look at the W3c spec, for CSS3.0 for example, 

00:02:19.315 --> 00:02:21.497
see what the paragraphs themselves say, 

00:02:21.497 --> 00:02:27.327
and then write a test case to verify that that paragraph is actually implementable in the browser.

00:02:27.327 --> 00:02:29.487
We'll constantly be listening for feedback

00:02:29.487 --> 00:02:35.118
we're looking for developers and customers to

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:38.611
tell us places where we're not behaving the same as other browsers, 

00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:43.975
and where it is affecting their ability to have the same code work across all browsers 

00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.539
We want to get that feedback as early as possible so

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.302
that we can make those changes and make those

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:53.117
improvements for the final release of IE9.

00:02:53.117 --> 00:02:57.766
I think as a web developer, I would be really excited 

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:59.181
for this release,

00:02:59.181 --> 00:03:01.659
and principly because I see the progress.

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.829
I've seen the progress in the Platform Previews and I know that this 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:07.939
browser is adhering to the standards,

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:09.802
and that really gets me excited!

00:03:09.802 --> 00:03:12.989
Y'know, I've worked on Internet Explorer for six years now, 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.819
it's been my entire time at Microsoft, 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.221
and every year on the browser it's gotten more and more interesting

00:03:19.221 --> 00:03:24.189
it's just exciting to see the browsers evolving and innovating 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.589
just get better and better

00:03:25.589 --> 00:03:36.065
every year.
